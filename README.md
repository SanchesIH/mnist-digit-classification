*Example images from the MNIST dataset*

This project is a classic starter project for practicing **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** using PyTorch. It focuses on classifying handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset. This is one of many starter projects I am working on to build and solidify my knowledge of **PyTorch, machine learning, and deep learning**.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build and train a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a widely used benchmark in machine learning, consisting of 28x28 grayscale images of digits (0-9). This project serves as a hands-on introduction to:
- **PyTorch** for building and training neural networks.
- **CNNs** for image classification tasks.
- Best practices for organizing machine learning projects.
